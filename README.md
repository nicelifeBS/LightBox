# LightBox for Modo 801
Collection of tools useful for lighting. All developed while lighting the bridge scene of Troll Bridge and it became more like a general tool set to automate tasks I repeatedly needed to do. E.g. creating proxies for plate image sequences or converting quicktimes to shotgun friendly movs with ffmpeg.

Since I am not using Modo atm this project is more or less stale.
